# Scratchpad

This is a dead simple scratchpad for macOS. If you ever need to take a quick note, this is for you. Summon it with a global hotkey and write away.

**No longer maintained.** Consider [Tyke](https://tyke.app/) or [Tot](https://tot.rocks/), free macOS apps which provide stellar globally-accessible scratchpads.
